# Audit Labs 🔬

**Automating the Evidence Trail for Modern & Legacy Infrastructure.**

Audit Labs is a specialized research and development duo focused on eliminating the manual burden of compliance. We build tools, scripts, and tutorials that programmatically gather audit evidence for **SOX, SOC 1-3, ISO 27001, and NIST** assessments.

### 🛠️ What We Do
We bridge the gap between complex system configurations and auditor requirements. Our focus is on **Evidence as Code**—turning manual "screenshotting" into repeatable, automated workflows.

* **Automation Development:** Custom scripts to extract compliance data via APIs and CLI.
* **Legacy Connectivity:** Bridging modern audit requirements with legacy systems like RACF.
* **Educational Resources:** Tutorials for auditors and engineers on how to automate their own evidence collection.

### 🌐 Automated Systems Portfolio
We have developed automation patterns and evidence-gathering tools for a wide range of environments, including:

* **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (Identity, Access, & Configuration)
* **DevOps Ecosystems:** GitHub & GitLab (Branch Protection, SDLC Compliance)
* **Identity & Access:** Mainframe (RACF), Active Directory
* **Data Layers:** Database Administration, Access Logs, & Rotation Policies

### 📋 Compliance Frameworks
Our tools are designed to satisfy control requirements for:
* **SOX** (Sarbanes-Oxley)
* **SOC 1, SOC 2, & SOC 3**
* **ISO/IEC 27001**
* **NIST** Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) & SP 800-53
